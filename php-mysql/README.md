# PHP/Apache2/MySQL Development VM

This is a Vagrant for an Ubuntu 14.04 virtual machine and chef code to
provision it with a PHP/Apache2/MySQL stack with Composer for dependency
management.  This allows for quick creation of a development environment on
that stack.

This way you don't have to think too much about setting up the stack when
pursuing a new idea, you can just dive in to development.
