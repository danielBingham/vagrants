# Laravel with MySQL 

This is a cookbook to provision a vagrant development environment for use with
a project built on the Laravel php framework using MySQL as a database.  It
will perform all the necessary provisioning to bring up a working VM.  

To use it, you'll want to copy it into your project's repo and modify
configuration values in ``attributes/default.rb`` to be appropriate for your
project.
